# andreasIPAM
Creating an IP address management program.
This program will help manage IP addresses within a business. It will manage all public and private IP address allocation and how many have been used and how many are still available to allocate within each subnet. 
As time goes on, this will be extended to include the following for each company:
- VRF
- Vlan
- details on the company itself
- different sites within a company
- As Numbers
